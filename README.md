# Doggone-It
Project for AI in Fact and Fiction Summer 2019

## Installation:
**1. Install Python 3(**NOT** 2.7):**  
   https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-369/
   Add Python 3.6 to your environment PATH. To check if the environment is there, type:
   > $ python
   
   It should open the python shell.    
**2. Clone the project through Git.**   
   Navigate to the root directory  
**3. Initialize virtual environment.**
     
     Windows:
     >   .\venv\Scripts\activate
      
     Mac/OS/Linux/WSL:
     >   source venv/bin/activate         
    
   This reads the file "requirements.txt", and places all the python dependencies into your virtual environment  
    
**5.  Run the app:**
   
   > python main.py
    
   If that doesn't work, run:
   
   > python3 main.py
